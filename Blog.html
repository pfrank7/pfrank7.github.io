      <h2>Edinburgh</h2>
      <img class = "img-responsive" src = "../photos/IMG_8034.jpg">
      <p> I am studying abroad in Edinburgh, Scotland for a semester. At first I was aiming to make a blog detailing all my ~adventures~
        but I have instead opted for what I hope can be a somewhat valuable resource. A guide to traveling cheaply in Europe for the 
        poor college student. Unfortunately, I'm only able to give detailed advice on the places I was able to explore but I hope
      it can be of use to someone out there. With that said, my first small tip is to keep an eye out for soup and bread. Its a great
      cheap and filling meal you can get just about anywhere for lunch. It doubles down in the cold months as a small way to warm 
      up.</p>

      <h3>Arthur's Seat</h3>
      <img class = "img-responsive" src = "../photos/IMG_7897.JPG">
      <p> Arthur's seat is one of the highest points near Edinburgh. It is easily walkable from the city center. All you have to do is put
      the big hill in your sights and head in that direction until you reach it. There is a fairly obvious path at the base of the hill that will 
      lead you to the top. It will start out as paved but end up rockier as you start to climb. I'd give yourself 30 minutes to make it
      to the top. I went in January, and while the walk warmed me up, the top was incredibly cold and windy, the wind being something that's
      hard to escape no matter where you go in Edinburgh. This lovely little excursion is completely free of charge and one of the "must 
      dos" when it come to the city of Edinburgh. I recommend hiking it near sunrise or sunset, sunset being the more dangerous of the two 
      as you'll be hiking back down in the dark.</p>

      <h3>National Museum of Scotland</h3>
      <p> Completely free! Yep, this national treasure is completely free to students (and potentially everyone although I didn't explore
        the other ticket options...The museum is home to Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned so thats pretty cool. 
      Other than that I would compare the museum to a cross over between a US history and science museum. While there are loads of artifacts
      there are also interactive exhibits on scientific concepts. </p>

      <p> While I don't know any historical significance of the location, this neighborhood in Edinburgh is exceptionally picturesque.
      Its the perfect place for a long walk along the small river or stream that runs through the neighborhood. </p>

      <h2>Paris</h2>
      <img class = "img-responsive" src = "../photos/IMG_7929.JPG">
      <p> My first weekend getaway was to the City of Love. A last minute round trip flight cost around 115 US dollars but I probably could have 
      found a cheaper one if I had planned a little farther in advance. When I say last minute, I mean I purchased the ticket 2 hours
      before the flight was scheduled to take off. Not a bad price when you take that into consideration.
       In general, Paris is not the cheapest European city to visit but it can be done. I traveled with 5 friends and we stayed in a hostel.
      Because there were so many of us, we were able to get an entire room to ourselves. The cheapest places to stay do tend to be hostels. 
      There may be cheap Air B&B's available but they are most likely not as centrally located. From our hostel we were able to walk to almost
      everything we wanted to see. </p>

      <h3>The Hostel</h3>
      <img class = "img-responsive" src = "../photos/1FD409F4-2195-47D4-9E2F-EFAB5416FEC2.JPG">
        <p> The per night price for our hostel was not particularly cheap coming in at around 50 US dollars a night. This was, just like the airfare, primarily due 
      to not booking ahead of time. So while it is possible to just show up in the city and find accommodations, if you want the best price you
      should take the time to plan ahead. The cheapest beds tend to be in dorm style rooms in hostels. Private rooms are available but they may
      be slightly pricier. Each has its pro's and con's. We were particularly lucky in that our hostel provided breakfast each morning - not all do. Overall
      you are going to want to be sure to read the reviews of wherever you choose to stay. Also know that if you are staying in a dorm bed you 
      may not have anywhere to store valuables while you are exploring the city so either don't bring them, or plan to carry them with you.</p>

      <h3>What We Did</h3>
      <h4>Laduree</h4>
      <img class = "img-responsive" src = "../photos/IMG_7969.jpg">
      So I didn't know Laduree was a big deal (or even what it was) till I went to Paris but turns out it is. Definetly not the cheapest place to get some
      macarons but surely the most famous.

      <img class = "img-responsive" src = "../photos/IMG_7929.jpg">
      I don't know if there is much to say about this one. Go to it. Look at it. Take pictures of it. If you want to drop a little extra
      money ride the elevator to the top of it. Be sure you get the chance to take a look at it in both the day at night. At night it
      sparkles at regular intervals so make sure you don't miss that either.

      <h3>Harry Potter?</h3>
      <img class = "img-responsive" src = "../photos/A8265C88-69C4-4AF6-B90B-F5E5F072DFB9.JPG">
      <p>Yet another free opportunity to take advantage of is the many free tours offered in Edinburgh including the Potter Tour we went on.
        The tour takes you around the city pointing out many of the inspirations and key places that led to the creation of the famous wizard
        series. For the dedicated Potter fan you can also take the time to grab a cup of coffee in the Elephant House, a cafe famous for the 
        time J.K. Rowling spent there while writing her books. You can also take the time to check out the Balmoral Hotel where Rowling finished
        the last Harry Potter book. For somewhere around Â£1000 individuals far richer than myself can reserve the specific room she stayed
        in for the night.

      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <p>I recommend budgeting yourself in pounds during your time in the Edinburgh. It's far too hard to convert back and forth between pounds
      and dollars every time you make a purchase and if you don't watch your spending at all it's very easy to spend far more than you imagined. One
      pound converts to almost 1.4 US dollars. </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What We Ate</h3>
      <img class = "img-responsive" src = "">
       <p> Crepes. Lots and lots of crepes. The little stands are on the corner of almost every touristy place you might go and for about 4 euros
         nothing hits the spot quite like a nutella crepe. Don't waste your time ordering them at a restaurant, you'll pay almost double for equal 
         or lesser quality.
      </p>
      <img class = "img-responsive" src = "">
      <p> Steak frites are the one thing we splurged on during our trip. Our very first night there we tracked down this place called
        Le Relais de l'Entrecote. The restaurant had Paresians and tourists alike lined up out the door and down the street. Because there were 
        5 of us we got to skip a bit of the line and got in after only about a 30 minute wait. The restaurant does not bother bringing you a 
        food menu because they only serve one thing, steak frites (or steak and french fries). By far some of the best steak I have had in my 
        entire life. The restaurant is well worth a visit and they will surprise you with the amount of food you get, however, its on the pricier end.
        One plate comes in at around 32 euros, so only go if you have the money to splurge.<small>Photo Creds to thisgirlabroad as I forgot to

      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <p> Take advantage of the Paris metro. It's not terribly difficult to use and can get you across the city for a few euros.
      We walked most places but when we found ourselves facing an hour walk we opted for a 20 min metro ride instead for only about 3 euros.</p>
